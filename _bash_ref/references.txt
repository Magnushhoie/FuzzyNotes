__mac overheating external monitor
# Discussed extensively in a few threads:
# https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22265235
# https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/16-is-hot-noisy-with-an-external-monitor.2211747/

# Seems to be hardware issue with usage of 2 GPUs.
# Fixes:
- Use USB-C instead of HDMI to external monitor (enforces more efficient GPU
  processing)
- Power macbook pro on right side instead of left side (further away from
  CPU/GPU -> less throttling due to heat)
- Enforce HiDPI mode (requires clamshell mode)
