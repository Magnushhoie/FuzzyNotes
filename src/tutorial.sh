1 of 6: ref --list

ref allows you to interactively search all your note files
( in $notes_folder )

You may view your note files and open them using "ref -l"
( After running the command,
SELECT file using arrow keys,
SEARCH filenames by typing )
EOF
practice "ref -l"
bash $script_dir/ref.sh -l
next_step

#

2 of 6: ref

ref interactively searches your note files for lines starting with __ or #
( exit with CTRL+C or pressing q )
EOF

bash $script_dir/ref.sh
next_step

#
cat <<EOF
3 of 6: ref [file] [pattern]

If you already know what you want to search for, you can input the
filename and search pattern as arguments.

bash $script_dir/ref.sh python for loop

Now let's edit some files!
refe -f interactively searches files and opens matching lines in vim
( to exit vim, press Escape then enter :q! )

Try searching for "vim commands" among your note files
EOF
practice "refe -f"
bash $script_dir/refe.sh -f
next_step

We can also create new files using refe.
refe --new tutorial.txt creates a new file in your notes folder.
EOF
practice "refe -n tutorial.txt"
bash $script_dir/refe.sh -n tutorial.txt
next_step

#
cat <<EOF
6 of 6: ref --help, refe --help

There are more ways to search using ref and refe.
You can see more examples and view all options using
--help
EOF
practice "refe -h"
bash $script_dir/refe.sh -h

echo
echo "End of tutorial. Good luck!"
